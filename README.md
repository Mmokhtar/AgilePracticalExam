## Possible Stakeholders
 - Cryptocurrency Traders
 - Cryptocurrency Trading Platforms

## Near Vision
### Sprint 1
At the end of sprint one, a usable form of cryptocurrency should be completed. The cryptocurrency's protocol should be HTTP based, to ease the creation of web-based applications that make use of the service. To make the cryptocurrency secure, the mining process will be based on the SHA-256 hashing algorithm (same as Bitcoin). A simple cross-platform application should be made to communicate with the P2P network.

Basic outlines of the sprint:
 - Initial version of the protocol between nodes in the network with future-proofing taken into account
 - Cross-platform Web, Desktop & Mobile application with the following features:
    - Ability to create a new wallet
    - Ability to transfer MA2 to another wallet
    - Ability to view wallet MA2 balance
 - Initial CPU-based mining software

### Sprint 2
At the end of sprint two, CCtokens (centrally controlled tokens) should be introduced into the MA2's network. CCtokens are the first addition that sets aside MA2's network from other cryptocurrency networks. CCtokens are tokens which are completely controlled and minted by a central entity (e.g. government, company). Both fungible and non-fungible tokens are to be implemented in this sprint.

Basic outlines of the sprint:
 - Ability to create new fungible and non-fungible CCtokens
 - Ability to mint new CCtoken instances of owned CCtokens
 - Ability to view owned CCtokens
 - Ability to transfer owned CCtoken instances to other wallets
 - Ability to transfer CCtoken ownership to other accounts

## Far Vision
MA2 Coin aims to be the main platform for the exchange of digital and physical commodities. MA2 coins themselves are to be used as the form of money, in the case the user wants to by or sell tokens. Tokens can represent physiscal commodities or digital items. Types of tokens are:

| Token Type | Explanation | Example |
| - | - | - |
| Fungible centrally controlled tokens (CCtokens) | Tokens that are minted by a central entity (e.g. company), and each token has the same value as every other token | Shares in a company |
| Non-fungible centrally controlled tokens (CCtokens) | Tokens that are minted by a central entity (e.g. government), and each token does not have the same value as every other token | Unit of real-estate (apartment, house, castle... etc) |
| Fungible single-mint tokens (SMtokens) | Tokens that are minted N times (defined tby the owner at creation), and can never be minted again | Limited stock products |
| Fungible voted-mint tokens (VMtokens) | Tokens that are minted N times (defined tby the owner at creation), and can only be minted again when more than 50% of token oners vote for it to be minted | High-risk product creation |

These 4 token types provide the users of the coin multiply ways to manage many trustless real-life environments in a quick and reliable manner.
