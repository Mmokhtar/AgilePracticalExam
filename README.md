 - Project Name: TACoin (Token Acquisition Coin)
 - Project Description: TACoin (Token Acquisition Coin) is a coin aimed at standardizing the creation and deployment of blockchain tokens (both fungible and non-fungible) which represent both digital and real-life assets. The main advantage of TACoinâ€™s system is the fact that it is both HTTP-based, and does not rely on the blockchain for the code that can be implemented off the blockchain network (unlike Ethereum).

## Possible Stakeholders
 - Cryptocurrency Traders
 - Cryptocurrency Trading Platforms
 - Token creators and distributors 
 - Token traders and owners
 - Frontend platform developers (Web/Desktop/Mobile)
 - Cyptocurrency developers
 - Cryptocurrency miners
 - Cryptocurrency miner software creators
 - Cryptocurrency mining pool managers
 - Cryptocurrency mining ASIC creation companies

## Near Vision
### Sprint 1
At the end of sprint one, a usable form of cryptocurrency should be completed. The cryptocurrency's protocol should be HTTP based, to ease the creation of web-based applications that make use of the service. To make the cryptocurrency secure, the mining process will be based on the SHA-256 hashing algorithm (same as Bitcoin). A simple cross-platform application should be made to communicate with the P2P network.

Basic outlines of the sprint:
 - Initial version of the protocol between nodes in the network with future-proofing taken into account
 - Cross-platform Web, Desktop & Mobile application with the following features:
    - Ability to create a new wallet
    - Ability to transfer TACoins to another wallet
    - Ability to view TACoin wallet balance
 - Initial CPU-based mining software

### Sprint 2
At the end of sprint two, CCtokens (centrally controlled tokens) should be introduced into the TACoin's network. CCtokens are the first addition that sets aside TACoin's network from other cryptocurrency networks. CCtokens are tokens which are completely controlled and minted by a central entity (e.g. government, company). Both fungible and non-fungible tokens are to be implemented in this sprint.

Basic outlines of the sprint:
 - Ability to create new fungible and non-fungible CCtokens
 - Ability to mint new CCtoken instances of owned CCtokens
 - Ability to view owned CCtokens
 - Ability to transfer owned CCtoken instances to other wallets
 - Ability to transfer CCtoken ownership to other accounts

## Far Vision
TACoin aims to be the main platform for the exchange of digital and physical commodities. TACoins themselves are to be used as the form of money, in the case the user wants to buy or sell tokens (instead of exchanging). Tokens can represent physiscal commodities or digital items. Types of tokens are:

| Token Type | Explanation | Example |
| - | - | - |
| Fungible centrally controlled tokens (CCtokens) | Tokens that are minted by a central entity (e.g. company), and each token has the same value as every other token | Shares in a company |
| Non-fungible centrally controlled tokens (CCtokens) | Tokens that are minted by a central entity (e.g. government), and each token does not have the same value as every other token | Unit of real-estate (apartment, house, castle... etc) |
| Fungible single-mint tokens (SMtokens) | Tokens that are minted N times (defined tby the owner at creation), and can never be minted again | Limited stock products |
| Fungible voted-mint tokens (VMtokens) | Tokens that are minted N times (defined tby the owner at creation), and can only be minted again when more than 50% of token oners vote for it to be minted | High-risk product creation |

These 4 token types provide the users of the coin multiply ways to manage many trustless real-life environments in a quick and reliable manner.

### Product Backlog Rationale
The items in the product backlog are ordered according to the value given to stakeholders. This value is decided according how much it makes the cryptocurrency usable for the real-life use cases of the coin. For example, TACoins themselves are more important than tokens because the exchange of money is more common in real life than the exchange of commodities.

Things to note:
 - The sprint size is intially 2 weeks
 - The average story-points per sprint is 80 story points
 - A story must be at max 40 story points before going into a sprint
 - Epics are sized anywhere from 100 to XXL, and do not follow the fibbonaci sequence (can be in any range between 100 and 200)

Story points are estimated in a modified fibbonachi sequence, then in the form of T-shirt sizes as follows:
 - 1:   10-20 of them can be done in a productive work day
 - 2:   6-9 of them can be done in a productive work day
 - 3:   3-6 of them can be done in a productive work day
 - 5:   2-3 of them can be done in a productive work day
 - 8:   1-2 of them can be done in a productive work day
 - 13:  Takes about 1 productive work day
 - 20:  Takes about 1-2 productive work days
 - 30:  Takes about 2-3 productive work days
 - 40:  Takes about 2-4 productive work days
 - 60:  Takes about 4-6 productive work days
 - 80:  Takes about 6-8 productive work days
 - 100: Takes about 8-10 productive work days   [`Epic Sized`]
 - 200: Takes about 10-20 productive work days  [`Epic Sized`]
 - L:   Takes about 20-40 productive work days  [`Epic Sized`]
 - XL:  Takes about 40-60 productive work days  [`Epic Sized`]
 - XXL: Takes about 60-80 productive work days  [`Epic Sized`]

\* A productive work day is meant for the whole team
